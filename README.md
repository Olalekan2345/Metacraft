# Project Title

A Solidity contract with a simple implementation of an ERC-20 token with functionalities for minting and burning.

## Description

This Solidity contract represents a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token with minting and burning capabilities. The contract includes several public variables that store information about the token, such as its name (MANCHESTER UNITED), abbreviation (MUN), and total supply (initialized to 0).

Moreover, the contract utilizes a mapping variable to keep track of token balances for each address. The mint function enables the creation of new tokens by increasing both the total supply and the balance of the specified address by the minted amount. On the other hand, the burn function allows for the destruction of tokens by reducing the total supply and the balance of the specified address by the burned amount. It's important to note that the burn function only executes if the provided address has sufficient balance.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* You will need a Solidity compiler like solc to convert your contract code into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
* Additionally, it is recommended to use a development environment or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Remix or Truffle to write, test, and deploy your contract.

### Executing program

* Set up a development environment or integrated development environment (IDE), such as Remix. Remix is a web-based IDE specifically designed for Solidity development. It enables you to write, compile, and deploy Solidity contracts directly within your web browser. Another option is to utilize Truffle, a widely-used development framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating and testing Ethereum applications.

* Once you have installed these tools, you can utilize them to perform tasks such as compiling, deploying, and interacting with your Solidity contract. To deploy the contract, you will need to connect to the Ethereum network using an Ethereum client and then deploy the compiled bytecode to the network. After the contract has been successfully deployed, you can employ various tools to interact with it, such as Web3.js or ethers.js. These libraries, developed in JavaScript, offer functionality for seamless interaction with Ethereum smart contracts.
